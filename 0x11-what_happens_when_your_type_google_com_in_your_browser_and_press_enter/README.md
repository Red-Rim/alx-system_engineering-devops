Background Context
Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack. A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area. Let’s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question.

Requirements
General
You can post your blog post on the platform of your choice; LinkedIn or Medium are good options.
A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
Tasks
0. What happens when... (Mandatory)
This question is a classic and widely used interview question for various software engineering positions. It is used to assess a candidate’s general knowledge of how the web stack works on top of the internet. One important guideline to begin answering this question is that you should ask your interviewer whether they would like you to focus on one specific area of the workflow. For a front-end position, they may want you to talk at length about how the DOM is rendering. For an SRE position, they may want you to go into the load balancing mechanism.

This question is a good test of whether you understand DNS. Many software engineering candidates struggle with this concept, so if you do well on this question, you are already way ahead of the curve. If you take this project seriously and write an excellent article, it may be something that will grab the attention of future employers.

Write a blog post explaining what happens when you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter.

Requirements: Your post must cover the following topics:

DNS request
TCP/IP
Firewall
HTTPS/SSL
Load-balancer
Web server
Application server
Database
Publish your blog post on Medium or LinkedIn; share the URL of your blog post in your answer file and in the field below.

Manual QA Review
